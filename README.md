# fftw3_for_android 



Simply run `build_arm.sh` in the source directory of FFTW3 to build the static library for Android. 

Maybe you should modify the path of your cross-compiler in `build_arm.sh`.

This shell script is a reference to https://github.com/hekai/fftw_android to some extent. But some modifications were made to adapt to the new version of NDK and fftw3.
